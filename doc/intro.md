# Backstory

In the year 2025, the Pacific "Ring of Fire" erupted in chaos. Devastating earthquakes and violent volcanic eruptions
occurred on a daily basis for six straight months. A strange, dark purple ash was ejected into the atmosphere, cooling
the planet for the next decade. About one third of the Earth's population died of famine. Science had no explanation
for the sudden activity, and millions believed it was the end of the world.

Meanwhile, a secondary phenomenon was occurring. Piezoelectricity began to exhibit strange properties. Quartz
oscillators were becoming less accurate, and many clocks and watches were off by several minutes per day. The
inaccuracy was more pronounced in areas where the ash was more highly concentrated.

Through experimentation, it was discovered the ash was radiating a new type of energy, which, when run through a 
piezoelectric material, caused a variety of effects. The energy became known as Austrum.
The material itself, with an unknown silicon-based molecular structure, was designated as austrum ash. The ash could
be tightly compressed into a dense cubic shape, called an Austrum Crystal, increasing the amount of radiated Austrum.
The piezoelectric component of an austric device was called the catalyst.

The amount of Austrum, the size, shape, and composition of the material all played
a role in determining the final effect. It was also discovered that Austrum could induce an electric current if
directed at a specific quartz structure. And so, out of the darkness emerged a potential blessing. A new source of
energy, new branch of science, and new laws of physics.

Austrum crystals became prevalent throughout society as strong, long-lasting, and portable sources of energy. And with
100 billion metric tons of raw material floating in the sky and settling on the ground, the supply appeared endless.

# The Other Effects

While the generation of electricity was the most celebrated discovery, Austrum was capable of far more. While the
experiments were still in early stages and kept highly classified, it appeared it could control matter and energy
within a radius of the catalyst. Of course, the radius increased with the amount of energy given, which also required
a larger catalyst to handle it.

As always, military applications were the first order of research. Guns utilizing rapid heat expansion of air to
propel bullets instead of gunpowder were one of the earliest and simplest inventions. A cycle of heating and cooling
allowed them to be shot at full auto, with less recoil than existing weapons. With no propellant required, magazine
sizes also increased considerably.

But we could go bigger. After all, explosions were just violent and rapid expansions of air, right? Austrum warheads
were packed with a refined austrum crystal, with a similar but stronger catalyst for causing heat bursts. However,
in early versions the energy release was too slow to make an explosion; it created more of a slow heat burst. This
led to the invention of austrum capacitors and austrum cables, which were general purpose enough to filter down to
consumer usage. 

Austrum cables worked off the same idea as fiber optics, whereby austrum was directed and reflected through a 
quartz-based tube. Austrum capacitors were similar, but more involved. Two plates of phase-changing quartz were
placed in a shell, allowing austrum to flow in and reflect on itself up to a certain point before releasing it
as a burst. At a high enough concentration, it would simply leak out rather than destroy the capacitor. This allowed 
for an intense burst of austrum to hit the catalyst all at once. The project was successful, with a destructive radius 
double the size of a conventional explosive. As a bonus, the power could be adjusted by the user before each explosive 
was released. Granted, the shockwave from the blast destroyed the warhead and broke apart the crystal, but that 
wasn't any worse than current systems.

Directed energy applications also proved successful, such as projecting a burst of extremely hot or cold air in a
direction from the weapon. Further evolutions were able to direct plasma at a distance of a few hundred meters.

Once targeting was invented, things drifted in a scary and "magical" direction. Running austrum through a separate
catalyst allowed the source of the main catalyst's effect to execute in a different location. In theory, it was now
possible to trigger a small explosion within someone's head, or instantly freeze someone's heart. In practice this
was difficult as the precision wasn't quite up to the task, especially against a moving target.

Still, the concern was enough that defensive measures had to be taken to protect targets from the effect of ranged
austrum attacks. Shield catalysts were created that prevent ranged austrum attacks from initializing within its
sphere of influence. Attacks triggered by much stronger austrum sources will not be completely blocked by the shield,
but will have their effects reduced. Continuous attacks can overload the shield and temporarily disable it.

Beyond defensive abilities, catalysts designed for repair also came into fruition. Since shields were blocking all
ranged austrum abilities, it could also block outside repair effects. This was rectified by tuning the devices on
a specific frequency, so a shield could let in effects that were triggered by allies.

Unfortunately for governments, nothing could stop a lot of these inventions from appearing in the public, and
eventually making their way into black markets as skilled crafters created and sold catalysts for heavy profits.
And if criminals had them, lawful citizens also desired them as a form of self defense, now that guns were not enough.

# Austrum Cross-Crystal Interference

It was found that two or more austrum crystals within a certain radius of each other would cause the emitted
energy frequency to become unstable, making the catalyst effects unreliable. This radius would increase depending
on the size of the crystal. Generally, this meant that only one crystal could be assigned per person or vehicle.
However, large crystals could still work if the only other ones nearby were much smaller. If a person had a small 
crystal while inside of (or near) a vehicle with a larger crystal, the effect would be negligible on the larger one, 
but the small crystal would be unusable.

# Personal Equipment

Personal-sized crystals range from 50 to 200cm^3, weigh between 120 and 480g, and output 250aW to 2.8kaW. They
will generally sit in an armored chamber with cables routing to a shield catalyst and other equipment. The shield
catalyst is usually kept very close, in another chamber next to the crystal. Together, the chambers can weigh
from 1 to 5kg and are embedded as part of a backpack. Austrum output can be routed to give more power to shields
or other equipment depending on the current situation.

# Vehicular Equipment

Combat vehicles can afford to carry much heavier setups, including more powerful shields and weaponry.

Vehicular-sized crystals range from 1,000cm^3 to 0.1m^3, weighing from 2.5 to 250kg with a power from 30kaW to 30MaW.
The cabling is also much thicker than with personal devices, and catalysts are larger, heavier, and more complicated.
Together, the crystal and shield device could weigh 10 to 1000kg. Smaller ones could typically be mounted on
motorbikes or ATVs, while larger ones see use in tanks and other large armored vehicles. Some special, extra large
vehicles may have even larger crystals, or multiple crystals separated by enough distance to prevent interference.

# Attack Types

- Heat (weakness)
- Cold (slow)
- Electric (stun)
- Water (eff against shield)
- Acid (damage over time)

- Slash (blade, sharp edge)
- Strike (fist, hammer, blunt object)
- Pierce (gun, rapier, bow, laser)

Some attack types can be combined, like a laser would be heat + pierce.

# Physics

- Austrum crystal density is 2.5g per cm^3
- The unit of Austrum energy is the Austric Joule, aJ. kaJ, MaJ, GaJ, etc.
- Austrum power follows the same logic: Austric Watt, aW, kaW, MaW, GaW, etc.
- When using Austrum to generate electric power, current technology converts at a 75% rate, so 1aW becomes 0.75W.
- A 1cm^3 cubic crystal radiates 1aW of power in all directions.
- Increasing the size exponentially increases the output. In a cube, the aW generated is about size^1.5 where
  size is measured in cm^3. A 25cm^3 cube would generate ~125aW.
- It is typical to have a rod-shaped crystal in a reflective quartz sleeve to direct most power in one direction.
- A marble or cube can also be suspended in a reflective chamber with attached cable(s).
- Austric cables can leak power if too much tries to go through a thin cable. Need math.
